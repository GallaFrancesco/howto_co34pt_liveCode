title: "SuperCollider as a Modular Synth"
---

A performance technique I don't generally employ a whole lot during Algorave-type sets using SuperCollider as a [modular synth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer) - and ProxySpace is _very_ strong in this regard too. Each NodeProxy can be seen as an individual module, and each module can be plugged into others to create a complex network of interconnected musical and control elements. This is achieved by setting up audio (.ar) and control (*.kr) proxies - for more info on audio vs control rate see [this](http://danielnouri.org/docs/SuperColliderHelp/Tutorials/Mark_Polishook_tutorial/Synthesis/4_Rates.html) and [this](http://danielnouri.org/docs/SuperColliderHelp/Tutorials/UGens-and-Synths.html)

I can't really talk about this in any great depth without using examples, so please see this section in the repo for an extended example of how SuperCollider can be used as a live-codeable modular synth. An important thing to note though is that if you want a lot of freedom in this approach, familiarity with types of UGens available (as well as some of the stranger quirks of SuperCollider syntax) will be very helpful.
